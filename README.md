## Requirements
**Important:** make sure that you have your [Profile Viewing Setting](https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?trk=nav_account_sub_nav_settings) changed from 'Anonymous' to 'Public' so LinkedIn members can see that you have visited them and can visit your profile in return.
You also must change your language setting to **English**.

LinkedInBot was developed under [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads).

Before you can run the bot, you will need to install a few Python dependencies. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

## Configuration
Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```python
# Required Login
EMAIL = 'youremail@gmail.com'
PASSWORD = 'password'

# Output Configuration
OUTPUT_FIELDS = 'url,name,connection_degree,country,email,phone,timestamp'
MAX_PROFILE_VIEWS = 1000

# Legacy Settings (optional)
VIEW_SPECIFIC_USERS = False
SPECIFIC_USERS_TO_VIEW = ['CEO', 'CTO', 'Developer', 'HR', 'Recruiter']
NUM_LAZY_LOAD_ON_MY_NETWORK_PAGE = 5
CONNECT_WITH_USERS = True
RANDOMIZE_CONNECTING_WITH_USERS = True
JOBS_TO_CONNECT_WITH = ['CEO', 'CTO', 'Developer', 'HR', 'Recruiter']
ENDORSE_CONNECTIONS = False
RANDOMIZE_ENDORSING_CONNECTIONS = True
VERBOSE = True
```

## Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Create `.env` file** with your LinkedIn credentials
3. **Run the bot**: `python LinkedInBot.py`
